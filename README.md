# Roundly
We cut corners.

Roundly is an Application written in XAML and C# that lets you round your PC's Screen.

Features:
* Adjustable Corners
* Change Color of Corners
* Run on Startup
* Hide to Tray

There are similar applications out there (RoundedScreen and Roundify), but they aren't adjustable, which is why I made this.

This is based off RoundedScreen by BeezBeez, but the Corners have been turned into Vectors and they're super adjustable now :)

Thank you to some people I know irl:

* Ms. Slay
* Spiderman
